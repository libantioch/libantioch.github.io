In particular, although there exist C++ chemistry libraries, such \r\nas [Cantera](http://code.google.com/p/cantera/), we had needs for both thread-safety \r\nand high performance. Thus, Antioch was born. Antioch originally lived within \r\nthe [PECOS](http://pecos.ices.utexas.edu) center at the Institute for Computational \r\nEngineering and Sciences ([ICES](https://www.ices.utexas.edu)) \r\nat [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu).\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAntioch has no required dependencies other than a reasonably modern C++ compiler.\r\n\r\nOptional Packages\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAntioch has been designed to allow several optional packages to facilitate vectorized \r\nevaluation of thermochemistry quantities. In particular, Antioch currently can support:\r\n\r\n1. [VexCL](https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl.git) - This package will enable GPU offload capabilities\r\n2. [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) - Highly optimized vector and matrix types\r\n\r\nBuilding Antioch\r\n================\r\n\r\nAntioch uses an Autotools build system, so typical GNU build commands are used.\r\n\r\n1. ./bootstrap (generate configure script)\r\n2. ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install (for more options, do ./configure --help)\r\n3. make (note parallel builds are supported)\r\n4. make check (note parallel-tests are supported)\r\n5. make install\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Development\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPull Requests for bug fixes and new features are welcome. Mailing lists have been setup for\r\nuser questions and discussion (antioch-users@googlegroups.com) as well as development questions\r\nand discussion (antioch-devel@googlegroups.com).",
